In the context of Apache Kafka, a "Kafka handler" typically refers to a component or class in your application code that is responsible for handling Kafka messages—either consuming (reading)
or producing (sending) messages to/from Kafka topics.

Depending on usage, a Kafka handler can be:

1. Kafka Consumer Handler

A method or class that receives and processes messages from a Kafka topic.

Example in Spring Boot:

@KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
public void handleMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    // Process the message
}

This method acts as the Kafka handler for messages coming into "my-topic".

2. Kafka Producer Handler

A component responsible for producing messages to a Kafka topic.

Example:

@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("my-topic", message);
}

3. Custom Kafka Handler (Generic Term)

In broader terms, any logic you write to handle Kafka interactions—like error handling, retries, custom deserialization—can also be called a "Kafka handler."

If you saw this term in a specific context (e.g., a log message, framework, or library), feel free to share and I can give a more precise explanation.

No, there is no standard annotation named @KafkaHandler in Apache Kafka itself — but there is an annotation called @KafkaHandler in Spring Kafka, which is used in a specific scenario:

@KafkaHandler (in Spring Kafka)

It's used along with @KafkaListener on a class to support multiple methods for handling different message types within a class-level message listener.

Example:

@KafkaListener(id = "multiHandler", topics = "my-topic")
public class MultiTypeMessageHandler {

    @KafkaHandler
    public void handleString(String message) {
        System.out.println("String message: " + message);
    }

    @KafkaHandler
    public void handleInteger(Integer number) {
        System.out.println("Integer message: " + number);
    }

    @KafkaHandler(isDefault = true)
    public void defaultHandler(Object unknown) {
        System.out.println("Unknown message type: " + unknown);
    }
}

This allows you to handle different payload types in the same class.

One method can be marked with @KafkaHandler(isDefault = true) to handle all unmatched types.

When to Use @KafkaHandler?

When your Kafka consumer needs to process multiple message types in a single class.

Common in message-driven polymorphic handling scenarios.
