In the context of Apache Kafka, a "Kafka handler" typically refers to a component or class in your application code that is responsible for handling Kafka messages—either consuming (reading) or producing (sending) messages to/from Kafka topics.

Depending on usage, a Kafka handler can be:

1. Kafka Consumer Handler

A method or class that receives and processes messages from a Kafka topic.

Example in Spring Boot:

@KafkaListener(topics = "my-topic", groupId = "my-group")
public void handleMessage(String message) {
    System.out.println("Received message: " + message);
    // Process the message
}

This method acts as the Kafka handler for messages coming into "my-topic".

2. Kafka Producer Handler

A component responsible for producing messages to a Kafka topic.

Example:

@Autowired
private KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

public void sendMessage(String message) {
    kafkaTemplate.send("my-topic", message);
}


---

3. Custom Kafka Handler (Generic Term)

In broader terms, any logic you write to handle Kafka interactions—like error handling, retries, custom deserialization—can also be called a "Kafka handler."

If you saw this term in a specific context (e.g., a log message, framework, or library), feel free to share and I can give a more precise explanation.
